This is an interpreter for the BASIC prgramming language.
Instead of using an emulator for an Atari or Commodore computer, this program can be used instead.
This will only work in the command line, so none of the color changing or sprite features have been added at this time.
List of commands:
    REM: Comments
    PRINT: Self-explanatory
    GOTO: Go to a specific line
    Variables are initialized with a "=" sign.
    IF, THEN statements where a test can include "=" or "<>"(not equal) for strings and numbers. "<", ">", "<=", and ">=" will all work for numbers.
    Math: + - / * % **
    To run a multiple commads on the same line, just separate them with a " : "
    INT(): Floors a floating-point number
    STR(): Converts a number into a string
    + can also be used for concatenation between strings and variables.
    INPUT(MESSAGE); VAR         is used to to take user input. VAR is the variable that it is assigned to. MESSAGE will be printed on the same line before input is taken.
  
*Note: Lines are separated by individual lines. There is no end-of-line symbol other than a break.*
**Note: Much of this program relies on spacing. Make sure that there is a SINGLE space separating each part of a line.**
