This is an interpreter for the BASIC prgramming language.
Instead of using an emulator for an Atari or Commodore computer, this program can be used instead.
This will only work in the command line, so none of the color chanigng or sprite features have been added at this time.
As of right now, no user input will work, nor will any math functions. These features should be added soon.
However, a list of what will work is:
    REM: Comments
    PRINT: Self-explanatory
    GOTO: Go to a specific line
    Variables are initialized with a "=" sign.
    IF, THEN statements where a test can include "=" or "<>"(not equal) for strings and numbers. "<", ">", "<=", and ">=" will all work for numbers.
    To run a multiple commads on the same line, just separate them with a " : ".
  
*Note: Lines are separated by line. There is no end-of-line symbol other than a break.*
**Note: Much of this program relies on spacing. Make sure that there is a SINGLE space separating each part of a line.**
